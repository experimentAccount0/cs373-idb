Lanthanum is a soft, ductile, silvery-white rare-earth metal element with symbol La and atomic number 57. In the periodic table, it is the first element of the lanthanide series (or, less frequently, the first element of the 6th-period transition metals). It is usually found in combination with cerium and other rare earth elements. Lanthanum oxidizes rapidly when exposed to air. It is produced from the minerals monazite and bastn√§site using a complex multistage extraction process. Lanthanum compounds have numerous applications as catalysts, additives in glass, carbon lighting for studio lighting and projection, ignition elements in lighters and torches, electron cathodes, scintillators, GTAW electrodes, and others. Lanthanum carbonate (La2(CO3)3) has been approved as a medicine for treating renal failure.
