Seaborgium is a synthetic element with symbol Sg and atomic number 106. Its most stable isotope 271Sg has a half-life of 1.9 minutes. A more recently discovered isotope 269Sg has a potentially slightly longer half-life (ca. 2.1 min) based on the observation of a single decay.[citation needed] Chemistry experiments with seaborgium have firmly placed it in group 6 as a heavier homologue to tungsten. Seaborgium is the only element named after a person (Glenn T. Seaborg) who was alive at the time the naming was publicized.
