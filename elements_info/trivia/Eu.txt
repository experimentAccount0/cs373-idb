@@Europium is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of lead.##

@@Europium is produced by nuclear fission, but the fission product yields of europium isotopes are low near the top of the mass range for fission products.##

@@Europium is not found in nature as a free element. Many minerals contain europium, with the most important sources being bastn√§site, monazite, xenotime and loparite.##
