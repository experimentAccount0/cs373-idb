@@Fermium was first discovered in the fallout from the 'Ivy Mike' nuclear test (1 November 1952), the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, 244
94Pu: this could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two ß- decays. At the time, the absorption of neutrons by a heavy nucleus was thought to be a rare process, but the identification of 244
94Pu raised the possibility that still more neutrons could have been absorbed by the uranium nuclei, leading to new elements.##

@@Because of the short half-life of all isotopes of fermium, any primordial fermium, that is fermium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only within a few months from the time of the synthesis. Einsteinium and fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.##

@@Although few people come in contact with fermium, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has set annual exposure limits for the two most stable isotopes. For fermium-253, the ingestion limit was set at 107 Becquerels (1 Bq is equivalent to one decay per second), and the inhalation limit at 105 Bq; for fermium-257, at 105 Bq and 4000 Bq respectively.##
