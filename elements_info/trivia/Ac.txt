@@Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, metallic element. Its estimated shear modulus is similar to that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles.##

@@Actinium is found only in traces in uranium ores â€“ one tonne of uranium in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of 227Ac##

@@Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium currently has no significant industrial use.##
