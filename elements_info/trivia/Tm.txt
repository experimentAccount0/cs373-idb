@@Pure thulium metal has a bright, silvery luster. While it affects the physical attribute of its color, the act of its luster becoming tarnished is due to a chemical reaction with the air and water.##

@@Thulium was discovered by Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve in 1879 by looking for impurities in the oxides of other rare earth elements (this was the same method Carl Gustaf Mosander earlier used to discover some other rare earth elements).##

@@The element is never found in nature in pure form, but it is found in small quantities in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium.##
