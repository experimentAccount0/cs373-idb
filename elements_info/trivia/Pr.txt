@@In 1839 Mosander extracted an oxide he called "lantana" (see lanthana), which was the oxide of the newly discovered element lanthanum, from a mixture of crude cerium nitrate.##

@@The name praseodymium comes from the Greek prasinos (πράσινος), meaning "green", and didymos (δίδυμος), "twin". Praseodymium is frequently misspelled as praseodynium.##

@@Praseodymium occurs in small quantities in Earth's crust (9.5 ppm). It is found in the rare earth minerals monazite and bastnäsite, typically comprising about 5% of the lanthanides contained therein, and can be recovered from these minerals by an ion exchange process, or by counter-current solvent extraction. Mischmetal, used in making cigarette lighters, historically contained about 5% praseodymium metal.##
