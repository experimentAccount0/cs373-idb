@@Lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature.##

@@The word lanthanum comes from the Greek λανθανω [lanthanō] (lit. to lie hidden). Lanthanum was discovered in 1839 by Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander, who partially decomposed a sample of cerium nitrate by roasting it in air and then treating the resulting oxide with dilute nitric acid.##

@@Although lanthanum belongs to the element group called rare earth metals, it is not rare at all. Lanthanum is available in relatively large quantities (32 ppm in Earth’s crust). "Rare earths" got their name because they were indeed rare as compared to the "common" earths such as lime or magnesia, and historically only a few deposits were known.##
