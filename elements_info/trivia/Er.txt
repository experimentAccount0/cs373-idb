@@A trivalent element, pure erbium metal is malleable (or easily shaped), soft yet stable in air, and does not oxidize as quickly as some other rare-earth metals.##

@@Erbium (for Ytterby, a village in Sweden) was discovered by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1843.##

@@he concentration of erbium in the Earth crust is about 2.8 mg/kg and in the sea water 0.9 ng/L.[9] This concentration is enough to make erbium about 45th in elemental abundance in the Earth's crust.##
