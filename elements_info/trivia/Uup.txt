@@ Ununpentium is the second-lightest element that has not yet received an official name. Using Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, ununpentium is sometimes known as eka-bismuth. In 1979 IUPAC recommended that the placeholder systematic element name ununpentium (with the corresponding symbol of Uup) be used until the discovery of the element is confirmed and a name is decided on. These recommendations are largely ignored among scientists, who call it "element 115", with the symbol of (115) or even simply 115. ##
