@@Lutetium, derived from the Latin Lutetia (Paris), was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James.##

@@Found with almost all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, lutetium is very difficult to separate from other elements.##

@@The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite.##
