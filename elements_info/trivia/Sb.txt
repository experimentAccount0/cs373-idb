@@ About 60% of antimony is consumed in flame retardants, and 20% is used in alloys for batteries, plain bearings and solders. ##

@@ Antimony forms a highly useful alloy with lead, increasing its hardness and mechanical strength. For most applications involving lead, varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying metal. In leadâ€“acid batteries, this addition improves the charging characteristics and reduces generation of unwanted hydrogen during charging. ##
