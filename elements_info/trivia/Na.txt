@@Sodium at standard temperature and pressure is a soft silvery metal, that oxidizes to grayish white unless immersed in oil or inert gas. Sodium can be readily cut with a knife, and is a good conductor of electricity.##

@@23Na is created in the carbon-burning process in stars by fusing two carbon atoms together; this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star of at least three solar masses.[14] The Earth's crust contains 2.6% sodium by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element on Earth.##

@@n humans, sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day.##
