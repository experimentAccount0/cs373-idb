@@At room temperature, fluorine is a gas of diatomic molecules, pale yellow when pure (but sometimes described as yellow-green).##

@@Among the lighter elements, fluorine's abundance value of 400 ppb (parts per billion) – 24th among elements in the universe – is exceptional: other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times as common.##

@@Fluorine is the thirteenth most common element in Earth's crust at 600–700 ppm (parts per million) by mass. Elemental fluorine in Earth's atmosphere would easily react with atmospheric water vapor, precluding its natural occurrence; it is found only in combined mineral forms, of which fluorite, fluorapatite and cryolite are the most industrially significant.##
